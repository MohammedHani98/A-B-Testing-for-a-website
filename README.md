# A-B-Testing-for-a-website

## Description
- This project aims to find the conversion rate for both the old and new website and whether it is beneficial to apply the new one or stick with the old website
- The project utilizes Python language to perform the statistical analysis and hypothesis testing for the final decision
- This project is part of Udacity Data Analysis project for Data Analytics Track

## Conclusion
To conclude, our analysis have reached the following results:
    <ul>
        <li> The results of the sampling distribution of the sample proportions did not provide so much evidence to reject the H<sub>0</sub>, which means that the conversion rate for the control group that has been shown the old page can be greater than or equal to the conversion rate of the treatment group that has been shown the new page
        <li> Using regression modelling, the coefficients of the variables included in the model, which are the type of the <b>landing page</b> (new or old), the <b>country</b> of the users (United Kingdom, USA, or Canada), the interaction between the countries and the landing page, and the <b>weekend</b> columns, were not statistically significant enough to say that they have an effect on the <b>conversion</b> variable.
